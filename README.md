**Step 4: Wiring the Components**

1. Connected:
    - HC-SR04 to A2 (Echo), A3 (Trig), 5V, GND
    - Servo to pin 11, 5V, GND
    - L298N to pins 2, 3, 4, 5 (motor control)
    - Motors to L298N output terminals
2. Wired the power system:
    - Battery pack (4x AA) ‚Üí switch ‚Üí L298N +12V
    - GND from battery ‚Üí L298N GND

**Step 5: Uploading and Testing Code**

- Wrote Arduino code using:
    - Servo.h to control ultrasonic scanning
    - NewPing.h to read distance values
- Created logic to:
    - Move forward by default
    - Reverse if object is ‚â§ 20 cm
    - Scan left/right and turn to clear the path
- Uploaded code and ran initial tests
- Used a simple test loop to verify motor movement and power delivery

**Step 6: Debugging Issues**

Identified and fixed key problems:

| **Issue** | **Solution** |
| --- | --- |
| Motors twitch but dont move | Power from USB was too weak, switched to battery pack |
| Motors stopped quickly | Improved solder joints to reduce resistance |
| Robot powered on, but nothing moved | Fixed wiring: connected 5V and GND from L298N to Arduino |
| Servo moved but robot didnt | Rewrote test loop to isolate power problem |
| Battery power didnt reach Arduino | Rerouted switch, 12V terminal properly |

**üîã Power-On Test:**

- Flipped the switch ‚Üí Arduino powered up
- Sensor servo rotated to scan surroundings
- Robot moved forward by default
- On detecting a nearby object (‚â§ 20 cm):
    - Reversed briefly
    - Turned either left or right based on which side was clearer
    - Continued forward after obstacle was avoided

**üß† Skills & Concepts Learned:**

**üß© Electronics:**

- Circuit wiring: connecting motors, sensors, servos, and drivers
- Breadboard prototyping and voltage flow understanding
- Power management: understanding current limits of USB vs battery
- Soldering techniques and their impact on performance

**üß† Programming (C++/Arduino):**

- Writing and uploading code in Arduino IDE
- Using libraries like Servo.h and NewPing.h
- Controlling digital output pins for motors
- Using sensor data to influence behavior (if-else logic)
- Servo control for environmental scanning

**ü§ñ Robotics & Mechatronics:**

- Using an ultrasonic sensor to measure distance
- Making decisions based on sensor input (avoid obstacles)
- Driving motors forward/backward and turning using an H-bridge
- Creating an autonomous robot that can think and act without user control

**üîã Debugging & Engineering Problem-Solving:**

- Diagnosing power issues (USB not enough current)
- Verifying connections using a multimeter
- Testing each module (motors, servo, sensor) independently
- Iteratively fixing wiring, solder joints, and logic errors


**üß© Challenges Faced & Solutions:**

| **Problem** | **Solution** |
| --- | --- |
| Robot only moved for a second | Discovered USB couldnt power motors, switched to batteries |
| Robot didn‚Äôt move at all | Rewired power delivery: battery, switch,motor driver, Arduino |
| Unstable soldering | Re-soldered connections to motor terminals with more precision |
| Confusing pin mapping | Studied and matched code pin numbers to hardware correctly |
| Wheels not turning smoothly | Confirmed motor power and rewrote test loop for verification |

Another main problem was just with the motor I ordered was faulty and would need help to get started. Was because of low quality plastic..


**Summary** 

This project marks the successful completion of my first fully autonomous robot: an obstacle-avoiding vehicle built using Arduino, an ultrasonic sensor, and motor control logic. Through this build, I gained hands-on experience in electronics, coding, sensor integration, power management, and real-world troubleshooting. The robot can detect objects in its path, make decisions, and navigate independently. This foundation sets the stage for more advanced mechatronics and robotics projects as I continue developing my engineering skills.
